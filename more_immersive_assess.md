# nixlarf's More Immersive Assess

The purpose of this homebrew is to codify Assess Actions, give them a bit of variety and some interesting side effects, in order to encourage the use of *many different types* of Assess Actions. An Assess is an Action and replaces Actions such as Attack, Sprint and Reload. When you gain Momentum from an Assess Action you may choose how to divide them among yourself and an affected ally. For example when you remove Broken Conditions with Leadership, you may choose to keep the Momentum yourself, or give it to the rallied ally.

For your Action, you can Test Leadership, and if Successful you may give away any number of your Momentum to intelligent allies who can hear you. If you gained Momentum from an Assess Action this Turn, you may use your Move for this instead.

Note that Assess Actions used to discover Traits or Talents cannot be used multiple times per Trait or Talent in the same scene, obvious Traits or Talents cannot be discovered through Assess Actions, and it is up to the GM whether discovering a particular Trait or Talent will earn Momentum. For example the Size of the Foe will usually be immediately obvious, knowing that a foe has the Craftsman Talent is unlikely to be helpful in combat, and magical training is usually required to identify whether the foe has Talents such as Instinctive Diction.

For all Assess Actions that require a target to be able to hear or see you, a higher SL may be required for targets that cannot hear or see you. For example it is hard to hear orders in especially chaotic battles, and it is hard to intimidate or distract a foe that is busy fighting someone else.


## **Animal Training**

When Assessing with Animal Training, for every 2 SLs above 0 you may identify which foes have a Trained Trait. You may choose in which order you want to discover Traits. If you Succeed, gain 1 Momentum, plus 2 for every distinct Trait you discover.

*Example: GÃ¼nther scores 5 SLs on his Animal Training. He asks about Trained (Magic), which no foes has. Next he asks about Trained (War), which 2 foes have. He lets the GM choose the next Trait, but no foe has another Trained Trait. He gains 3 Momentum.*


## Athletics/Ride/Swim

In the right environments you may attempt to maneuver into a better position. If you Succeed you gain 1 Momentum, plus 1 Momentum for every 2 SLs above 0.


## Charm/Charm Animal

If an intelligent foe can hear and understand you, you may taunt it with an Opposed Charm/Cool. If it has the Bestial Trait you may Taunt with an Opposed Charm Animal/Cool Test. If you win the Test you gain 1 Momentum, and if you win by at least 2 SLs your foe has Disadvantage on Attacking anyone else on its next Turn, and you gain 2 more Momentum.


## Drive/Row/Sail

When steering a vehicle or vessel, you may attempt a maneuver using Drive, Row or Sail. If you Succeed, you gain 1 Momentum, plus 2 Momentum for every SL above 0. Note that a significant Failure may have undesirable consequences...


## Entertain/Perform

If your foe can understand you, you can use an appropriate Entertain to distract your foe, or you may use an appropriate Perform to distract any foe. If you win the Opposed Test against the target's Cool you gain 1 Momentum. If you win by at least 2 SLs your target gets Disadvantage on its next Attack, and you gain another 2 Momentum.


## Heal

You may use Heal to assess the physiological state of your foes. For every 2 SLs you may identify a foe as having less than half its Wounds remaining, a Critical Injury from before, or be affected by a symptomatic disease. If you Succeed, gain 1 Momentum, plus 2 Momentum for every such discovery.


## Intimidate

When you Assess with Intimidate, you may perform an Opposed Intimidate/Cool Test against a foe that can hear or see you. If you Succeed, you gain 1 Momentum, and if you Succeed by at least 2 SLs you gain 1 more Momentum and count as having Fear (1) against this foe until the end of your next Turn. If the intimidated foe has any Momentum, it loses the same number you gain. If it gains any Broken Conditions before the end of your next Turn you gain another 2 Momentum. Note that the foe will have to test Cool if you use your Move to move closer. This does nothing against foes who are immune to intimidation.


## Intuition

When Assessing with Intuition, for every 2 SLs you may discover which foes have a certain Talent. You may choose in which order you want to discover Talents. If you Succeed, gain 1 Momentum, plus 2 for every distinct Talent you discover.


## Language (Battle)

When Assessing with Language (Battle), if you Succeed you gain 1 Momentum, plus 1 Momentum for every 2 SLs above 0 times up to IntB allies who can understand you. If your foes can understand you they gain the same number of Momentum per foe who can understand you.


## Language (other)

When Assessing with Language (other), if you Succeed you gain 1 Momentum, plus 1 Momentum for up to IntB allies who can hear and understand you. If your foes can understand you they gain the same number of Momentum per foe who can understand you.


## Leadership

If you use Leadership to Assess, you may remove 1 Broken Condition from an intelligent ally who can hear you for every 2 SLs above 0. If you Succeed you gain 1 Momentum, plus 2 Momentum for every Broken Condition removed this way. If you Succeed, up to FelB intelligent allies who can hear you gain +10 to Psychology Tests until your next Turn. For every Psychology Test passed by an affected ally you gain 1 Momentum. A combatant can only be affected by one Leadership, Play or Pray Assess at a time.


## Lore (foe)

When Assessing with Lore (foe), for every 2 SLs above 0 you may identify which foes have a certain Trait associated with its species. You may choose in which order you want to discover Traits. If you Succeed, gain 1 Momentum, plus 2 for every distinct Trait you discover.


## Lore (Warfare) TODO


## Navigation TODO


## Outdoor Survival

When you Assess with Outdoor Survival, if you Succeed you gain 1 Momentum and identify an advantageous terrain feature, plus another feature for every 2 SLs above 0. Examples may include an easily climbed tree, a high ground to swing from, or a rock that provides cover. For every such feature, the first ally to occupy it gains 2 Momentum. Note that the difficulty of this Test can be very easy in rough terrain, and impossible in a featureless landscape.


## Perception

When you Assess with Perception, undiscovered foes Oppose your Perception with hidden Stealth Tests. If you Succeed you gain 1 Momentum, plus 1-4 Momentum per discovered foe, depending on the threat levels of the discovered foes.


## Play

You may inspire your comrades by playing an instrument. If you Succeed you gain 1 Momentum, plus 1 Momentum for up to FelB allies with Drilled who can hear you. Additionally, up to FelB intelligent allies who can hear you gain +10 to Psychology Tests until your next Turn. For every Psychology Test passed by an affected ally you gain 1 Momentum.  A combatant can only be affected by one Leadership, Play or Pray Assess at a time. Note that instruments are not equally easy to hear over the clatter of weapons, and may have differing difficulties.


## Pray

When Assessing with Pray, if Successful gain 1 Momentum, plus the following number of Momentum per up to FelB allies who can hear you and shares your faith:



* Some foes are considered hostile and no foe is considered protected: 2 Momentum.
* Some foes are considered hostile, some are considered protected: 1 Momentum.
* Some foes are considered protected, no foe is considered hostile: -1 Momentum.
* Otherwise: 1 Momentum.

Additionally, up to FelB allies who can hear you and share your faith gain +10 to Psychology Tests against foes considered hostile. A combatant can only be affected by one Leadership, Play or Pray Assess at a time.

Note that oftentimes, most foes will be considered protected in the eyes of pacifist gods like Ranald, Rhya and Shallya. Additonally, a higher SL may be required if it is hard to hear the prayer, or a combatant does not consider the target of the prayer his primary Deity.


## Stealth

You may use Stealth to maneuver into a more advantageous position. If you Succeed on your Stealth Test you gain 1 Momentum. If you attack a foe on your next Turn, your foe must Oppose this Stealth Test with Perception, and if you win you gain 1 Momentum before your Attack.
